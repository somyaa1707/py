explanation:
Assignment_1 :
task-1: in this we simply had to get the numbers from
 the user using the input command and then use those
  numbers to do all type of calculations that is add,
  sub,mul and divide.Also as we know division by zero 
  is not defined so using if else condition the possibility
  of error is reduced in order to give the correct
  output.


  task-2:in this task we have to get the full name of the
  user and the concatenate the name i.e. first name and 
  last name with a simple greeting message using the +
  operator.


  Assignment-2:
  task1:in this we have to tell the user that whether the
  number is even or odd. to do this simple if and else
  conditions are applied.if the number given by the user 
  on dividing by 2 doesn't give any output then that number
  is even otherwise odd.

  task-2:in this we need to use for loop to iterate over
  the numbers and also a sum variable is also used to 
  get the sum of the numbers falling in the given range.


  Assignment-3:
  task-1:factorial function is defined to get factorial of the
  numbers given by the user.

  task-2:in this we have imported the math module to use the 
  functions such as square root,natural log etc.

  Assignment-4:
  task-1:in this a simple file handling function is done in which
  we have made a sample file and now we have to read the content of that file.

  task-2:in this we have to create an output file and have to write new
  as well as append some data in that file.

  Assignment-5:
  task-1:a dictionary with key value pair is created of students name and marks
  the user may enter the name of any student to get the record of its marks.

  task-2:in this task we have to define a list ranging 1-10 and then 
  slice that list in both normal and reversed order.
